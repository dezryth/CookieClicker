# Cookie Clicker
This is a simple app I created for my girlfriend's little brother who at the time played a game involving clicking a cookie more than his friends had for bragging rights. I decided to help give him an edge and to try to encourage him into learning some programming.

By default, there is a limitation of 10 clicks per second. While already more than the average human can click, this could be raised by the adventurous user with a simple modifaction of the source code.
